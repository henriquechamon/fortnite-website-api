### To do:
- Implement clickable cards with item data
- Add date in the upper corner
- ~~Fortnite stats search with username~~
- ~~Item's background changes depending on it's rarity~~
- ~~Rest of the items from the shop (Featured specials)~~
- ~~Fix vBucks icon in item cards~~
- ~~Proper mobile UI~~

### Known issues:
- ~~Duplicate items because of bundles (Sorting issue)~~
- Broken stats. RIP

PS. This is a personal project with many flaws and ugly/silly code.
If you're looking for proper tracker there are alot of options on google. :)
